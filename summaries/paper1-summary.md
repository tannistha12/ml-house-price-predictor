## ðŸ§  Paper Summary â€“ Machine Learning Techniques for House Price Prediction ( MAY 2025 | IRE Journals | Volume 8 Issue 11 | ISSN: 2456-8880 )

- **What is the paper about?:** The paper is about predicting housing prices accurately to hehlp buyers, sellers and investors make informed decision. The models are 
trained on publicly available datasets containing historical data on house sales.   
- **Algorithms Used:** Random Forest and Gradient Boosting 
- **Something new I learned:** Many researchers compare multiple ML models (like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree) instead of using just one, and ensemble models (e.g. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) often give the most accurate performance for predicting house prices.
- **Which idea/technique I might use in my own project:** I might start with a simple Linear Regression model, and then try using ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to improve the accuracy of my house price prediction ML model.
